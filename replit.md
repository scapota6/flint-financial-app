### Backend Architecture

- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with JSON responses.
- **Route Configuration**: API routes mounted first before static files, JSON 404 handler with path for unknown API endpoints, comprehensive JSON error handler ensuring all API errors return JSON (never HTML).

### Key Components
- **Authentication System**: Replit Auth for user authentication with session-based, PostgreSQL-stored sessions and protected routes.
- **Database Schema**: Tables for Users, Connected Accounts, Holdings, Watchlist, Trades, Transfers, Activity Log, Market Data, Price Alerts, Alert History, and Notification Preferences.
- **Alert Monitoring System**: Background service for price alerts with debouncing, quiet hours, and email/push notifications.
- **Financial Data Management**: Multi-account connections, real-time balance tracking, portfolio management, trade execution simulation, transfer management, and watchlist.
- **Subscription System**: Three-tier model (Basic, Pro, Premium) with Stripe integration for payment processing and feature gating.
- **Security Framework**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive credentials, multi-tier rate limiting, activity logging with sensitive data hashing, secure PostgreSQL-backed sessions, double-submit-cookie CSRF protection with csurf (x-csrf-token header validation), session revocation on logout, RBAC middleware, encrypted token storage, automatic secret rotation, SOC 2 compliant infrastructure.
- **Wallet Service Architecture**: Internal fund management with pre-authorization and hold/release, integrated ACH transfers via Teller.
- **Teller Payments Integration**: Credit card payment system using Zelle-based transfers with tellerForUser client wrapper for per-user authentication, MFA handling with 409 status codes, and real-time payment status tracking.
- **Trading Aggregation Engine**: Complete trading system with intelligent routing, real-time position consolidation, pre-trade validation, enhanced instrument resolution with cross-SDK compatibility, robust trade preview/placement APIs with version-safe wrappers, tradeId-based order placement with fallbacks, comprehensive error handling with detailed debugging, and flexible validation flow supporting both preview-then-place and direct placement workflows.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated service layers for encryption, wallet management, and trading aggregation.
- **Compliance Framework**: Legal disclaimers system (not a financial advisor, custodian, or broker-dealer) with user acknowledgment tracking, RBAC groundwork, and security dashboard.
- **Settings Management**: Profile management, notification preferences, connected accounts management, data export (CSV), and account deletion.
- **Teller Balance Mapping System**: Dedicated utility (`server/lib/teller-mapping.ts`) that properly maps Teller.io account balances to Flint's internal format. For credit cards: ledger (amount owed) is mapped to positive `owed` field and negative `displayBalance` to reduce net worth; credit limit is calculated as ledger + available (total borrowing capacity). For depository accounts: available/ledger is mapped to positive `displayBalance`. Ensures accurate net worth calculations by treating credit card debt as negative balances.
