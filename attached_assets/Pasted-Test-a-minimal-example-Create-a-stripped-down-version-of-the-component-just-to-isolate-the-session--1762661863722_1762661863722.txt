Test a minimal example:
Create a stripped‐down version of the component just to isolate the session issue:

import { WhopCheckoutEmbed } from "@whop/checkout/react";

function TestEmbed({ planId, sessionId }) {
  return (
    <WhopCheckoutEmbed
      planId={planId}
      sessionId={sessionId}
    />
  );
}


See if that renders (and maybe redirects) — if this fails with same error, then the core session property issue remains.

Check the backend creation endpoint:
Your backend flow creates a session via POST https://api.whop.com/api/v2/checkout_sessions. The docs confirm that endpoint is correct.

Confirm you pass required fields (e.g., plan_id, maybe metadata) and you parse the returned id field and deliver that to frontend.
The response model shows id field holds the session.

🔧 Next steps / fix suggestions for you

In your component props list, try adding sessionKey={sessionId} in addition to sessionId. See if the error goes away.

Log sessionId right before the component render to confirm it’s exactly the value returned from backend and not mutated.

Check network/console logs to see if any wrapper script complaining about required property — maybe also inspect the iframe’s query parameters (if possible) and see if session_key or sessionId param is present.

If you imported @whop/checkout/react, make sure you’re not also manually including the loader script <script src="https://js.whop.com/static/checkout/loader.js">, unless the docs for React version still require it. Remove redundant script if present.

Check the official example: docs show minimal usage with just planId and optionally sessionId.

As a fallback, consider switching temporarily to the vanilla embed approach (non-React) to verify isolate whether the session property issue is React-SDK specific:

<div
  data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
  data-whop-checkout-session="ch_XXXXXXXXX"
  data-whop-checkout-skip-redirect="true"
></div>
<script async defer src="https://js.whop.com/static/checkout/loader.js"></script>


If that works (with session property), then you know the issue lies in React wrapper props mapping.
