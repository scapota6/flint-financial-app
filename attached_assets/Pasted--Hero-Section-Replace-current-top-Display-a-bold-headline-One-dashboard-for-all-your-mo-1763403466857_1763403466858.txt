 **Hero Section (Replace current top)**
   - Display a bold headline: “One dashboard for all your money – free forever (up to 4 accounts).”
   - Under it, write: “Connect your bank, card, investing and crypto accounts in minutes. See everything. Act instantly.”
   - Place a large CTA button: “Get Started Free (No Credit Card Needed)” that scrolls to the sign-up section.
   - Include a small email capture form directly below the hero text: a single input for email with a submit button (“Get updates”). This form should store the email in state (no backend) and display a thank-you message, then encourage the user to continue to signup.
   - Right beside or behind the text, show a graphic or video loop of a Flint dashboard (can be a static image placeholder in this version).

2. **Trust & Partners Section**
   - Keep the horizontal scrolling icon strip of banks and brokerages (the current “partners supported” logos) intact. Put it below the hero or at the top of this section.
   - Below the icons, list trust messages: “5,000+ users already managing their money with Flint,” “256-bit encryption,” “Read-only connections,” and show a shield icon.
   - Remove any unlinked media logos. If actual press coverage exists, include only linked logos; otherwise omit.

3. **Features Section**
   - Replace the current feature grid with three horizontally aligned cards (stack on mobile):
       1. **All Accounts in One Place** — Brief text: “Unify banks, cards, stocks, and crypto in one dashboard.”
       2. **Real-Time Insights & Alerts** — Brief text: “Track spending, fees, and net worth in real time. Get automatic alerts.”
       3. **Act Right From Flint** — Brief text: “Transfer money and trade without leaving the app.”
   - Use simple icons next to each card heading. Keep the wording at a 3rd-grade reading level (short and clear).

4. **Interactive Demo Section**
   - Add a section titled “See Flint in Action.” Include an interactive or pseudo-interactive mock dashboard (dummy data) so visitors can click around a sample: show total net worth, list of accounts, and a transaction list. Below it, add a button “Try with sample data” that switches the mock display to another dummy set, plus a note like “Ready to see your own? Sign up free.” 
   - Provide an optional “skip demo” link.

5. **Simplified Signup Section**
   - Create a signup section triggered by the main CTA or a separate “Create your account” area:
       - Ask for Full Name, Email, and Password (or allow Google/Apple sign-in). Do not ask how many accounts or what type.
       - Place a note under the form: “No credit card required. You can connect up to 4 accounts on the Free plan.”
       - After a successful signup (just client-side), show a confirmation message and redirect the user to a “Get Started” page or the demo dashboard.

6. **Pricing & Plans Section**
   - Add a pricing section farther down the page:
       - Two columns: **Free** (0$ forever – up to 4 accounts, basic dashboard) and **Pro** ($39.99/month or $399.99/year – unlimited accounts, premium tools). 
       - Beneath Pro, show daily cost: “≈ $1.10/day,” and a note: “Save 15% with annual billing.” 
       - Include an upgrade CTA button in the Pro column (“Upgrade to Pro”), which triggers a mock payment process.
       - Remove any “coming soon” labels and do not list features not currently available.

7. **FAQs & Footer**
   - Create an FAQ accordion with plain-language answers to: 
       *“Is my data secure?”*,
       *“How many accounts can I connect for free?”*,
       *“Can I cancel anytime?”*,
       *“How does Flint make money?”*,
       *“Why should I upgrade?”*.
   - Build a simple footer: left side shows Flint’s logo text; right side lists Terms, Privacy, Support links. Include a small line: “Flint is not a broker or bank. Investing and transfers depend on the platforms you connect.”

8. **Email Capture & Exit Intent**
   - Add a secondary email capture: if a user scrolls halfway down the page but hasn’t clicked the CTA, show a small pop-up at the bottom: “Stay in the loop! Enter your email for updates and beta invites.” This should not block the page but gently prompt them to subscribe.
   - When the user’s cursor moves to close the tab or navigate away, trigger an exit-intent modal saying: “Don’t leave empty-handed! Get our free financial planning checklist. Enter your email to receive it.” This captures emails even from drop-offs.

9. **Leave Existing Partner Logo Scroll Component**
   - Retain the original JavaScript/CSS for the horizontally scrolling partners’ icons from the existing site, ensuring it still runs smoothly in the new layout. Place it near the trust section as specified above.

10. **General Design & Copy**
   - Keep the dark background aesthetic and simple sans-serif typography consistent with the existing brand. 
   - Use large margins and spacing to avoid clutter. Use plain language (3rd-grade reading level) throughout: no complex sentences or jargon.
   - Ensure all sections are responsive on mobile. The CTA button should be prominent and repeated at least three times throughout the page.

11. **Code Delivery**
   - Deliver full, copy-pastable React component files: App.jsx (main page), components for sections (Hero, Trust, Features, Demo, Signup, Pricing, FAQ, Footer), and a CSS file (or CSS modules) with all styles. Include placeholders for the interactive demo data and handle basic state for form submissions and pop-ups on the client side. Do not include any backend logic.

This prompt is meant for Replit’s AI to produce a working, ready-to-copy version of the new Flint landing page. It should remove the old long application form, keep the partner logos scroller, add email capture opportunities, and highlight the free plan while making the upgrade path clear and compelling.
