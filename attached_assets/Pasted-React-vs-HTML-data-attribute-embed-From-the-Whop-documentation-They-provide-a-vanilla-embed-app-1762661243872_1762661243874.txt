React vs HTML/data-attribute embed

From the Whop documentation:

They provide a “vanilla” embed approach using attributes like data-whop-checkout-plan-id, data-whop-checkout-session, etc., on a <div> and loading the script https://js.whop.com/static/checkout/loader.js.

For React (or modern JS frameworks) the docs recommend using their iframe SDK (@whop/react + @whop/iframe) which gives you typed communication via window.postMessage.

Because you’re using React, yes, you’re better off using the React-specific integration (the SDK) rather than purely relying on data attributes. The data-attribute approach can still work (you can mount a <div> inside a React component) but you lose some of the React/SDK benefits (callbacks, better event handling, typed API).

So:

If you’re comfortable with React and want robust behavior (modal, callbacks, session management) → use the SDK (@whop/react).

If you want a quick embed and don’t need full SDK features → data attributes can work.
Since you’re implementing more complex flow (session creation → modal overlay → callback) I suggest using the SDK.

🔍 Key “props” / attributes / config to check

Here are the major pieces you need to ensure are covered. Whether using SDK or embed, these need to be present:

planId: The ID for the plan the user is buying (e.g., "plan_XXXXXXXX").

sessionId / sessionKey: The session created via your backend must be passed to the embed/SDK so the checkout knows which session. The “sessionKey is a required property” error indicates you omitted this.

skipRedirect (or equivalent): So when checkout completes you stay in your app/modal rather than a full redirect.

callback / onComplete / event listener: To know when user completes purchase so you can update UI / backend.

Modal / overlay wrapper: Because you want the pop-up UI not full page, so the embed or SDK call must run within a modal component in React.

SDK Provider: In React, you likely need to wrap your app or component in WhopIframeSdkProvider from @whop/react according to docs.
